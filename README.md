# Watchlist

Watchlist is a tool to keep track of all unseen and seen movies.  
It shows you the movies which are recommended by your friends.

## Installation

Just download the [installer](https://github.com/NorthropBtwo/Watchlist/raw/master/WatchListUpdater.exe) from github.

Do not download the whole repository.  
The installer takes care of that.
